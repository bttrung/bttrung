# System Design Principles

Dimensions:

* **Scalability:** a system is scalable if it is designed so that it can handle additional load and will still operate efficiently.
* **Reliability:** a system is reliable if it can perform the function as expected, it can tolerate user mistakes, is good enough for the required use case, and it also prevents unauthorized access or abuse.
* **Availability:** a system is available if it is able to perform its functionality (uptime/total time)**.** Note reliability and availability are related but not the same. Reliability implies availability but availability does not imply reliability.
* **Efficiency:** a system is efficient if it is able to perform its functionality quickly. Latency, response time and bandwidth are all relevant metrics to measuring system efficiency.
* **Maintainability:** a system is maintainable if it easy to make operate smoothly, simple for new engineers to understand, and easy to modify for unanticipated use cases.
